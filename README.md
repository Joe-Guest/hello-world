# hello-world
First repository, for testing and ideas

My name is Joe, I've been coding for about 10 years now on and off. 
I originally started in high school with a class that taught Visual Basic, then moved on to take a course in Java, and then advanced Java.
I had a breif foray into C# via XNA Framework and made a few classic game clones like Pong, Breakout, etc. 

Then I took a long break from programming... I'm still not sure why, but I'm getting back into again. 

Now I'm onto Python and really enjoying it; programming is fun again. 
I made this account to help organize the projects I decide to work on, and hopefully to keep me organized and motivated to continue.
